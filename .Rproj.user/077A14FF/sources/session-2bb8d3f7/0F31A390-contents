intro: My name is Shubham, and I am a data scientist and an analyst with a passion for problem-solving and a love for nature. With 4+ years of experience in leveraging data to drive business decisions, I have gained a deep understanding of key know-how around this regime, while contributing to the success of several organizations, including Amazon, Bain, Pfizer, and ZS. I have a knack to draw connections between seemingly unrelated concepts and I strive to apply this approach to my every day work. Whether it's developing predictive models or analyzing complex datasets, I always try to think outside the box and come up with innovative ways to solve problems.

nature-love: While being passionate about data and innovation, there is a wild side of mine that craves adventure. My love to explore the great outdoors sometimes takes me trekking through the mountains, bouldering my way up a challenging rock face, and sometimes under clear skies for a calming star gazing night. There's something about being surrounded by nature that is  inspirational and sparks creativity.

more: In addition to this love of the outdoors, I am an avid chess player and enjoy a good game whenever I can find a worthy opponent. Reading books and spending time with family are other activities that bring me joy and keep me grounded.

closing: If you're looking for a data scientist who brings a unique perspective and a passion for adventure to the table, connect with me and explore how we can work together to drive your business forward :)
